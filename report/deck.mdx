## Useful definitions

- **Betweenness** of a node &mdash; how many shortest paths in the network pass through this node.

  - <small>Higher value means connecting different areas of the network.</small>

<!-- For example, imagine you are Leia and you want to send a message to Greedo - the shortest path how
to send it is via Han Solo, because he interacted both with Leia and with Greedo. On the other hand
if you want to send a message to Luke, you donâ€™t have to go through Han because Leia knows Luke
directly. The betweenness centrality for Han is computed using the number of shortest paths between
all other characters that pass through him. -->
